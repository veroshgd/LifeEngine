goal-pair mini audit — the go/no-go precondition for Probe C "home falls into disrepair"
========================================================================================

Run:  python goal_pair_audit.py --seeds 300

The capacity audit measured "99.3% of balls used ≥2 kinds of goal", **but that does not automatically
show that the two particular goals `see_the_world` and `improve_home` are common enough** — most of it
could be `stock_food` / `recover`.

The whole design of Probe C rests on the conflict between that pair of goals, so first confirm just three things:

  ① how many agents actually raised each of them
  ② what share of goal-days each takes
  ③ how many agents experienced **both** (a conflict needs an object)

★ group-blind ★ Only pooled quantities and between-individual variance are printed. Seeds `20000+`.
**Do not touch `60000–61499`.** No mechanism is implemented, and v3 is not modified.
